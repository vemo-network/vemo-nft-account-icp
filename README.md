# Vemo NFT Account Frontend
This is FE of NFT Account module, refer here for more information https://docs.vemo.network/

## üöÄ Develop
Run npm run dev in your terminal, and then open localhost:5173 in your browser.
Once the webpage has loaded, changes made to files inside the src/ directory (e.g. src/App.tsx) will automatically update the webpage.
If making local changes to the SDK, note that npm build must be run inside the tokenbound-sdk/packages/sdk directory before the changes will be reflected in this example implementation.

## üöÄ Deploy

# In a new terminal window:
```bash
dfx deploy # Deploy smart contract locally
```

The smart contract will be reachable under `http://bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai.localhost:4943`.
Call the smart contract using `curl` on the command line: 

```bash
# contacts endpoint
curl http://bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai.localhost:4943/contacts
# price-oracle endpoint
curl -X POST http://bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai.localhost:4943/price-oracle -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"pair": "ICP-USD"}'
```
You can also use tools like Postman or HTTPie to interact with the smart contract.
To redeploy the smart contract, run `dfx deploy` again.

When ready, run `dfx deploy --ic` to deploy your application to the ICP mainnet.
The command will print a different canister URL for mainnet, ending in `.raw.icp0.io`.
You can make calls to the smart contract on mainnet just like to the local one!

## üí° Tips and Tricks

- When developing remotely, navigating to the canister's frontend in the browser will not work.
Use `curl` on the command line instead, or develop locally.

- Note that you might need to disable CORS in your browser to make backend calls from `localhost`.
For example, for Chrome, run `open -n -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --args --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev_test" --disable-web-security`
 to disable CORS.

- If you get an error "Error: An error happened during communication with the replica: ... Connection refused", run `dfx start --clean` to start dfx.
